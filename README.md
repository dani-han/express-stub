# Express-Stub project

Without `*.mjs` and `--experimental-modules` options, Node.js (v8+) does not support module importing statement `import`.

## Usage

1. Clone this project.

2. Run `yarn install` to collect out and install dependancies.

3. Run `yarn start`. If you get the message like below, it is sucessfully installed:
```
...
Express-Stub app listening on port 3000!
```

4. Hit `F5` key, and open a browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You will see:
```
Hello World!
```
